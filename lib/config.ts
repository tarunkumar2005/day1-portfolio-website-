  description: `I am Tarun Kumar, a dedicated software developer specializing in creating efficient and scalable web applications. With over 2 years of hands-on experience in web development, I have honed my expertise in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, React.js, Next.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and TypeScript. I excel in developing REST APIs, handling JSON data, and implementing modern web architectures.\nCurrently, I am broadening my skillset by learning cutting-edge technologies such as PostgreSQL, better authentication systems, cloud-based development tools like Arcjet, and mobile app development with React Native. I‚Äôm also delving into large language models (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) to enhance data-driven applications through intelligent API integrations.\nThroughout my journey, I have successfully completed personal projects and freelance projects, sharpening my technical acumen and problem-solving abilities. I am also working on a personal platform, *Creatique*, aimed at gaining deeper insights into platform development and user-centric design.\nAs a student and an avid learner, I am committed to pushing the boundaries of technology, continuously refining my skills, and embracing challenges that drive innovation.`,
